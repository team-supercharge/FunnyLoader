# Download and usage

Get the latest artifact via gradle
```groovy
compile 'io.supercharge:funnyloader:0.2.0'
```

Use as a standard `TextView`

```xml

  <io.supercharge.funnyloader.FunnyLoader
        android:layout_width="wrap_content"
        android:layout_height="wrap_content"
		...
        app:funny_postfix="..."
	app:funny_autoStart="true"
        app:funny_animation_duration="1500" />


```
**Animation**

The animation starts automatically if app:funny_autoStart is true (default is false). We can also start it programatically:

```
FunnyLoader funnyLoader = (FunnyLoader) findViewById(R.id.funnyLoader);
funnyLoader.start();

...

funnyLoader.stop();

```
